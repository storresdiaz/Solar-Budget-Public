                <p class="mt-5" style="font-weight:200;">Budgeting is one of those things that many of us want to do but never seem to find the time to do. Making time to manage your money, on the other hand, can provide a slew of advantages. So, how does one go about creating a budget? And how do you keep it up?
                    <br><br>This blog will help you understand some budgeting strategies you can use to manage your money as efficiently as possible!</p>
                    
                <br><h3>What is a budget?</h3>
                    A budget is, at its core, a spending plan. It considers all of your income and expenses and ensures that you do not spend more than you earn. Budgets vary in complexity, ranging from a simple one-page sheet for personal spending to complex software programs for corporate finances.
                    
                    <br><br><h3>How do you budget your money?</h3>
                    It may appear to be a daunting task, especially if you've never really examined your finances before. With a little know-how, however, you can soon be pulling the financial strings in your household.
                    <br><br><h3>Examine your income and expenses.</h3>
                    The first thing to do is assess your current financial situation. This means gathering your bank statements, pay stubs, bills, receipts, and any other financial records you may have. The goal here is to calculate an average monthly spend so that you can see where your money is going with each paycheck (assuming you get paid monthly).
                    You must account for all forms of income that are deposited into your bank account regularly. Add it up for each month and divide it by the number of months for which you have records. This is your monthly earnings average.
                    <br><br><h3>Determine your necessities.</h3>
                    When it comes to spending, the first place to start is with your essential or fixed costs. Rent, groceries, gym memberships, childcare, and so on are examples of such expenses. Of course, you'll need to look through your statements, bills, and receipts to see how much money you spend on each of these. Make sure to double-check each calculation.
                    <br><br><h3>Determine your disposable income.</h3>
                    Your disposable income is frequently where things get a little dicey. It refers to the money left over after you've paid for all of your necessities. When you're reviewing your financial records, make a list of everything you spend money on that isn't necessary and start adding it up. Remember to account for any cash transactions you make.
                    Work out your savings.
                    Along with your essential costs and disposable income, it's important to consider how much money you're currently saving each month. Consider ISAs, pensions, investments, rainy day funds, and even money you put in your piggy bank regularly.
