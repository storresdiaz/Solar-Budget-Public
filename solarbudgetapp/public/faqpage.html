                            <p>Solar Budget is a zero based budgeting program. 
                                Simply put, that means each month every penny is assigned to something.</p>

                        <h2 class="mt-2">What are monthly assignments?</h2>
                        <p>Monthly assignments are what Solar Budget asks you complete each month. Update your balances
                            according to the assignments, and pay down your debts as asked. They're meant to make managing
                            your finances super simple. <b>Did you buy a new rug for your apartment? Well, make sure you subtract the cost from your
                            spendable money fund.
                            </b> It really is that simple.

                        <h2 class="mt-2">How do annual expenses work?</h2>
                        <p>The annual expenses column takes whatever you put in minus what you have in your annual expense fund, and divdes it by the remaining amount of months in the current year.
                            This makes sure that on January 1st of every year, you have all the necessary funds to cover your annual expenses.</p>

                        <h2 class="mt-2">How does my emergency fund work?</h2>
                        <p>At first, Solar Budget will try to get you to a $1000 emergency fund. Afterwards Solar Budget will assign money towards your emergency fund as it sees fit. 
                           It's important for the emergency fund to be filled to avoid having an inconvenience completely take you off track.

                        <h2 class="mt-2">How does my spendable money work?</h2>
                        <p>Your spendable money can be used for anything that is not an emergency, and in the case that you don't have an emergency fund, to be used for emergencies.
                            However, it is important to use this consistently for yourself to start building proper spending habits and not feel constrained. 
                            Date nights, knick-knacks for your home, anything that is not a necessary expense will come out of your spendable fund. Feel free to also use this fund to save for things
                            such as down-payments on a car, home, or any other spending goals in general.

                        <p>Solar Budget will assign money to debt but still keep you comfortable with spendable money. 
                            This makes sure it's a breeze to stay on track, and to make sure you can pay off your debt in a much quicker manner.
                            We recommend any money assigned to debt go to an underwater car loan first, and <b>then</b> to your other debts from smallest to largest.
